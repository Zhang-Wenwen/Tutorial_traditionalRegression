Course project, tutorial and practice for multi-classification problem. To run different machine learning methods, refer to following files. Part of the code has referred to function in [1].

LDA : ./wine_LDA.m 

PCA: ./wine_PCA.m 

KLDA: KLDA and LDA are in the same directory, call KLDA_proj_reduce in LDA get results.

KPCA:./FinalKPCA.m

SVM:SVMWine.m

FCM: FCMWine.m

LogicRegression:logicRe.m

ANN:myann.m
